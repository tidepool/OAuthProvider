amused,amusement,You're feeling **amused**,"Charlie Chaplin once called laughter ""the tonic, the relief, the surcease of pain.""  If that's true, then you're not hurting too bad right now.  Instead, you're feeling completely amused, enjoying the humorous and entertaining aspects of life.  You might or might not be totally content and happy with how things overall are going, but you're definitely able to laugh.  This ability to find humor in life can serve you well.  It can give you perspective and keep you from taking certain problems too seriously, and it can help you enjoy even the little things in life, appreciating them for the joy they can bring.  So keep laughing, enjoying the world around you - it's good for you. "anger,anger,You're feeling **angry**,"Right now you're feeling pretty angry.  Something seems to have really gotten to you.  There's nothing at all wrong with that; everyone gets mad.  The big question is what you do with that emotion.  Simply being aware of it - recognizing your clinched teeth, your tightened stomach muscles, and your quickened heart rate - is a great first step.  Good for you.  Now, how do you want to respond to the situation?  An extreme response would be to go all Tony Soprano on whatever or whoever's upset you, yelling and cursing and losing total control.  (We're assuming no one would get ""whacked."")  On the other extreme would be a Gandhi-like response, full of peace and non-violence.  We can't tell you what to do.  What's most important is that you make an intentional decision - one based not on a thoughtless, knee-jerk reaction, but on your core beliefs and principles."awe,awe,You're experiencing **awe**,"At this moment you're feeling complete and utter awe.  Something incomprehensible has absolutely blown you away, and you've experienced an overwhelming feeling all through your body and mind.  You might have gotten goose bumps, or felt a tingling on your shoulders or the back of your neck.  This speaks really well of you.  As Einstein said, ""He who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead; his eyes are closed.""  Whatever else is going on in your life, maintain your ability to wonder, to stand rapt in awe, to keep your eyes open.  Doing so will keep you sane when the world gets chaotic, and just crazy enough when things threaten to become predictable and boring.  It will keep you alive."boredom,boredom,You're feeling **bored**,"Not exactly feeling engaged with the world right now, are you?  Looks like you're feeling more bored than anything.  You're having trouble getting interested in some activity or subject, and it just doesn't seem worth your time to concentrate any energy on it.  That certainly happens, and it's not necessarily concerning if this is a temporary emotion you experience only every now and then.  If, however, boredom has become one of the main lenses through which you view your world, that's probably something you want to give some attention to. After all, one of the keys to being happy in life is to find something you're really interested in, even passionate about.  Firefighters, accountants, dentists, and rodeo clowns:  they can all be bored with their lives.  But not if they find something that inspires their passion."confused,confusion,You're feeling **confused**,"Feeling perplexed at the moment?  Confused?  Maybe even mystified by someone or something in your life?  That's a common experience.  No matter how much we may try to control the world around us and get to where everything makes sense, life continues to be less than neat, even messy.  It's important right now that you pay attention to what you're experiencing with this emotion.  Is it leading you towards anger, where you'll want to be careful about how you react?  Or do you feel more like life has simply handed you a fun and whimsical surprise you hadn't expected?  Wherever your confusion is coming from, do your best to watch what other emotions might result from it.  That awareness can help you respond in ways that feel good - both to yourself and to everyone around you."contentment,contentment,You're feeling **contented**,"Free and easy, that's how you're riding right now.  You feel contented.  Satisfied.  Happy and at ease with the world.  What a gift, to be able to view life through a lens that lets you feel that sense of calm throughout your body.  Not everyone can do this, so appreciate the fact that you can.  Be grateful for this moment and the joy it brings.  One question:  What do you want to do now?  In other words, as you look at the world from this happy, peaceful, clear-minded place, are there situations you need to address, or relationships that could use your attention?  If you're going to make important life decisions, there are few better emotional states from which to do so than the contentment you feel now."coyness,coyness,You're feeling **coy**,"At this moment you seem to be feeling a bit coy, which is similar to feeling shy or reserved.  But really, it's more complicated than that.  Maybe ""playfully shy"" would be a better description.  It's as if you're feeling modest or demure, but with a desire to affect someone around you in some way.  This shows that you have some impressive emotional breadth, in that you can experience these complex and almost contradictory desires simultaneously.  On one hand, you're holding back and hiding yourself from someone in your life; but on the other, you're looking to affect or even control that person to a certain extent.  This coyness can add a lot of fun and flavor to life and relationships.  Just make sure that you maintain a healthy amount of directness and honesty in your relationships as well, since manipulation can lead to problems and conflict that can damage trust in significant ways."desire_food,desire for food,You're experiencing a **desire for food**,"Right now one main feeling is overpowering all others for you:  a desire for food.  It might be that eating always plays this kind of extremely significant role in your life.  Or maybe you just haven't eaten in a while and you're pretty anxious to strap on the old feedbag.  If it's the latter, and you're simply hungry because it's been a good while since you've had a meal, that's pretty normal.  If it's the former, though, and you've gotten to a place where you've become so fixated on food that it's pretty much always on your mind, this might be something you'd want to visit with someone about - a trusted friend, or even a professional.  "desire_sex,desire for sex,You're experiencing a **desire for sex**,"One of the most common and formidable emotions a person can experience is the desire for sex.  It's unbelievably powerful, isn't it?  It's primitive and instinctual, with the ability to overshadow everything else in our world.  As Woody Allen put it, ""I don't know the question, but sex is definitely the answer.""  At the moment, you have a decent idea of just how powerful the desire for sex can be.  That desire is natural and healthy, so don't deny or fear it.  But do be aware of its power.  Since right now it's acting on you in a pretty big way, pay close attention to how you respond to your desire, making wise decisions and carefully considering the consequences of your choices."disgust,disgust,You're experiencing **disgust**,"Of the various emotions you're experiencing at the moment, one of the strongest appears to be disgust.  Something has really gotten to you.  It's more than that you're simply turned off, or even offended.  You're completely and utterly sickened - possibly to a literal degree - by whatever it is that's bothering you.  In fact, what you're experiencing may have an uncontrollable physical component to it, making you gag or want to actually vomit.  One of the best ways to deal with this reaction is to do what you're doing right now:  acknowledge it.  Recognize the disgust you're experiencing for whatever reason, and allow yourself to understand that that's what you're feeling.  Then, out of this awareness, you can begin to take steps toward alleviating those repulsive feelings in some way."embarrassment,embarrassment,You're feeling **embarrassed**,"Right now you're feeling pretty embarrassed.  Maybe something went wrong at work, or maybe it was in your personal life.  Whatever it was, it's left you hyper-aware of your mistake and almost completely unable to let go of it.  Most likely, your stomach is in knots as you re-live your mistake over and over again in your mind.  Embarrassment is pretty much a universal emotion.   That's why the ""most embarrassing moment"" story is actually a classification of stories - because everyone has one.  We're not saying that you shouldn't feel embarrassed right now; it's important not to squelch your emotions.  But we would encourage you to realize that we all mess up and humiliate ourselves from time to time.  Just realizing that you're not alone can sometimes help a good bit.  Also, as much as possible, stay in the present moment.  Embarrassment is focused on the past, so the more you can give your attention to current responsibilities and situations, the less the past can control you."fear,fear,You're feeling **afraid**,"You may be experiencing many different emotions in this moment, but one clearly stands out above the others:  fear.  For whatever reason, you're afraid - of someone, of some thing, or maybe of a coming event.  When you think about whatever you fear, your body most likely responds.  Your upper eyelids probably go up; your body most likely becomes tense; and your breathing might quicken.  Fear like this can overpower us, making it hard to focus on anything else in our lives.  It can affect our performance at work and the way we relate with the people in our lives.  For this reason we encourage you to talk about what you're feeling, either with someone you trust, or maybe with a professional.  Now that you're aware that you're afraid, address those feelings as fully as possible, so they don't act on you without your knowledge."happiness,happiness,You're feeling **happy**,"It appears that you're not having too bad of a day.  You seem completely and utterly happy.  You probably can't keep from smiling, and most likely there's a lightness you feel within your body.  Just think about that for a moment:  Out of all the emotions you're experiencing right now, happiness is one of the very strongest!  Talk about something to appreciate!  Don't take these feelings for granted.  People aren't happy all the time, so when we are, we should recognize how we feel and enjoy the moment.  Also, think about ways you can share your joy with the people in your life.  What steps can you take to multiply what you're feeling by passing it on to those around you? "interest,interest,You're feeling **interested**,"Something has really caught your eye and imagination, hasn't it?  You're feeling extremely interested in some person or object or idea, and it has fully engaged your attention.  That can be highly enjoyable, focusing completely on something that fascinates you and grabs hold of your intellectual curiosity.  Explore this curiosity, allowing yourself to examine where it might lead you.  It's important that you make wise decisions and carefully consider possible negative consequences to certain actions you might take, but there's nothing wrong with fully examining a possibility or concept that pops up before you and asks you to think about what it might mean."pain,pain,You're experiencing **pain**,"It's one of the most difficult things anyone ever has to deal with: intense, overwhelming physical pain.  It can overshadow everything else in a person's life, leaving them unable to enjoy simple pleasures and even meet basic responsibilities.  At the moment, you seem to be dealing with this type of pain.  Somewhere in your body you're hurting so much that it's the most intense feeling you're currently experiencing.  We assume you're seeing a doctor.  In addition, you might seek out other types of pain-management resources.  Some people have found it helpful to avail themselves to pain clinics, mindfulness exercises, and other ways to help them deal with their conditions.  We've listed several places to get started here."pride,pride,You're feeling **proud**,"You feel extremely proud right now.  You might be taking pride in a personal accomplishment, or in something about a larger group to which you belong.  For whatever reason, you're receiving a ton of satisfaction from something that recently happened.  Your shoulders are probably back, and your chin is slightly higher than usual.  We're happy that you're appreciating this moment, enjoying it for all it's worth. If you're proud of something you've done yourself, go ahead and tell someone about it.  Choose a person close to you, someone who will know you're not simply bragging, and share your accomplishment.  Let yourself enjoy it.  And if you're feeling proud of something someone else has done, share that, too.  Congratulate other people, and spread around the pride you're feeling, letting others enjoy it as well."relief,relief,You're feeling **relieved**,"Whew!  You feel totally relieved.  Seems like you dodged a bullet, and now you're letting out a big sigh.  Allow yourself to feel the relief in your body.  Go ahead and do it right now:  Release all the tension in your shoulders, in your neck, in your arms, in your legs.  Feel it leave your body.  Now enjoy this moment.  Appreciate the relief you're experiencing, and be aware of the weight that's been lifted off your shoulders.  Then, from that relieved, clear-minded, tension-free place, decide what you want to do next.  Do you need to make amends with anyone?  Are there steps you should take to avoid future problems?  Should you share the relief with another person?  Enjoy making decisions about future actions without being dogged by the prospect that everything is about to blow up in your face."sadness,sadness,You're feeling **sad**,"You're feeling a good bit of sadness right now.  You're really hurting, either for yourself or for someone close to you.  Most likely you feel it in your shoulders, which might be drooping, or in the pit of your stomach, where there might be actual physical pain.  Those close to you can probably recognize that you're suffering when they look at your face.  It's good to feel deeply, and it's healthy to allow yourself to experience whatever emotions appear in response to the events in our lives.  But did you know that according to scientists at the Mayo Clinic, ""only 10% of the variation in people's reports of happiness can be explained by differences in their circumstances""?  What matters more is our personality and, most hopeful of all, our thoughts and behaviors.  That means that how we think and act goes a long way towards determining how happy we are.  So even though sadness is a significant emotion for you right now, realize that to a large degree, you can choose to be happier when you're ready.  It may take a lot of time, and you definitely shouldn't deny your authentic feelings.  But remember that you do have the ability to at least balance them with other emotions when you're ready."shame,shame,You're feeling **ashamed**,"When people feel shame, they often experience a literal pain in the pit of their stomach.  They may avoid making eye contact with others, their chin can drop, and their posture will be what we call ""collapsed.""  You may be experiencing some of these sensations right now, possibly because of how you feel about yourself at the moment, or because of a choice you made or a regret you have.  Or maybe the shame results from something someone said, or the way someone's treated you.  If you're experiencing intense feelings of shame, we strongly encourage you to find someone to talk to, whether it's someone you know and trust, or maybe even a professional.  It's important that you recognize and address feelings of shame, because if left alone they can poison even the good things in your life."surprise,surprise,You're feeling **surprised**,"Something really snuck up on you, didn't it?  Left you in a state of total surprise.  One interesting fact about surprise is that it's the briefest emotion, since once it appears; it's usually gone almost immediately, as we begin to understand what really happened.  At that point it can begin to be transformed into any number of emotions:  fear, amusement, anger, shame, triumph, and so on.  Where is your surprise leading you at the moment? Are you more happy or less? Just as important, do you want to respond to this particular situation? If so, how? What constructive action could you take that helps not only yourself but also the people around you?  Try to discover specific ways you can allow your surprise to lead you towards a positive and productive response to this situation. "sympathy,sympathy,You're feeling **sympathetic**,"You're currently experiencing one of the noblest emotions of all:  sympathy.  The reason we consider it so noble is because it's a feeling focused not on your own problems, but on the pain of someone around you.  In fact, that's actually what the word ""sympathy"" means:  to suffer with others.  Your ability to suffer with someone else is honorable - although we're pretty sure it's not exactly enjoyable at the moment.  You're hurting with someone you care about, and that's painful.  We encourage you to remain aware of these compassionate emotions you're experiencing, without allowing them to overpower you.  Keep feeling deeply, and continue to care about the people in your life.  But take care of yourself as well, and avoid drowning in your sympathy.  After all, you can't always save others from suffering.  Keep caring for the people around you, and stay true to yourself along the way.  "triumph,triumph,You're feeling **triumphant**,"Victory.  Success.  Triumph.  That's what you're feeling right now.  You did it!  You faced every obstacle, withstood every challenge, and came out on top.  And now you get to reap the rewards of your conquest.  We congratulate you and encourage you to fully appreciate this moment.  Revel in it, allowing yourself to recall each and every moment you thought you couldn't keep going, but did. "flagged_result1,low emotion,You're feeling **little emotion**,"Whereas most people experience fairly strong emotions on a regular basis, you don't.  In fact, identifying and even recognizing your own feelings isn't exactly your strong suit.  You prefer to look at situations and people from a logical, rational perspective.  The problem, though, is that whether you recognize and identify your feelings or not, they're still there inside you, working on you in powerful ways.  And as you've probably experienced, they can build up so much that one seemingly minor detail can set you off, leading you to react in ways you're not proud of.  So do all you can to pay attention to subtle signs that your emotions are running higher than usual - clinched teeth, tight muscles, etc. - and begin to notice those signs for the red flags that they are.  This can help you maintain control of your feelings and, therefore, your actions.  Also, keep in mind that the people in your life probably need more emotional connection and sustenance than you do.  You may be a camel who can go a long time without a drink of emotional nourishment, but most people get thirsty and need you to pay more attention to their feelings."
