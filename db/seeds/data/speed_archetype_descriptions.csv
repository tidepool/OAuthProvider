falcon,"You likely feel you are on top of your game.  It is a great time for problem solving. You may be prone to impulsivity. Make sure you come back and check your work later.  Your overall speed is great, just remember what they used to say about speed."cheetah,This isn't the perfect time for you to solve really complex problems. You seem to be in a good mindset to socialize. Mentoring or teaching could be productive ways for you to spend some time. Reflection on your past couple of days may feel quite positive.antelope,"You seem to be in a real creative state of mind. One way of describing you right now is as the Absent Minded Professor. While you have a handle on the big picture, the details may well escape you at the moment."cat,You have plenty of options on what to do right now. Your clearest strength involves making rapid quick decisions. So if you are a coder or a CPA now is the time to settle into a nice long session. Almost anything that requires fluid intelligence is something you will succeed in now. Like maybe planning that around the world trip on G Maps?wolf,So do you see the glass as half empty or half full today? That question is relevant because you seem to be in-between your cognitive strengths and weaknesses.  You can pay attention to details better than sometimes and you also have a good sense of the big picture. Pick up the task that needs to absolutely get done. Guaranteed you have the tools needed to get it done. dog,Sometimes your state of mind may suggest something about life beyond what we usually think about when we think about mind. That's kind of where you are right now. You should give yourself permission to catch up with a friend and maybe explore that art lession you've been thinking about. Good time to also just veg out or attend to those pending chores.crow,"Okay, we don't think there really is such a thing as multitasking. But nonetheless you can make fairly complex decisions quite rapidly. This is great for tasks like coding and writing.  Just remember to check the details later because your focus on individual details is not as sharp as it usually is."gorilla,"You are not blazingly fast right now. But you are in a state of mind where talking with friends or engaging in moderate exercise may help you re-energize yourself. You don't always have to be bouncing around the internet with 30 different tabs open. Reflect, recharge, and hit it hard in a while."dolphin,"This is not the time to focus on details or on trying to do things quickly. On the other hand you can think out of the box. This seems to be an ideal time to indulge your creative side. Spend some time brainstorming by yourself, and then with some others."progress1,progress2,progress3,
