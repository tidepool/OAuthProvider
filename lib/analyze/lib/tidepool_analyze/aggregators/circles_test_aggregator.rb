      # 1. Calculate the z-scores for each of size, distance and overlap
      # 2. Each name_pair (trait1/trait2) maps to an attribute of the game type (E.g. Openness for Big5)
      # 3. Multiply the z-scores by corresponding weights
      # 4. Add the weighted z-scores per attribute of game type.
      # 5. Average the weighted z-scores
      # The output is in the form of:
      # {
      #   :openness => {:weighted_total => num, :count => count, :average => average },
      #   :agreeableness => {:weighted_total => num, :count => count, :average => average }
